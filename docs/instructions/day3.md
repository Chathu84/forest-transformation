# Day 3 — Insights & Sharing
**Focus:** synthesize what you learned, polish visuals, and create a short, public-facing story. Make a plan for next steps.

## 1) Findings at a glance
- On **Home** → `docs/index.md`, write 2–4 **headline bullets** in plain language.
- Include one number if possible (change, contrast, uncertainty note).

## 2) Visuals that tell the story
- Choose **2–3 strongest visuals**: maps/plots/GIFs. Replace placeholders in **Home**.
- Ensure captions say: *what it shows* and *why it matters*.

## 3) Produce a 1–2 page brief (optional but encouraged)
- Export a short PDF (figures + bullets). Link it from the **Home** hero section.
- Keep it readable for non-experts.

## 4) Plan what’s next
- In **Home → What’s next?** add 3–5 bullets:
  - Immediate follow-ups (1–2 weeks)
  - If we had one more month…
  - Who should see this next (stakeholders)

## 5) Polish & acknowledge
- Add team details to **Team** page.
- Add any citations to **Cite & reuse** on **Home**.
- Verify licenses (code and data) are stated.

## 6) Report-out prep
- Practice a **2-minute walkthrough** of the homepage: Why → Questions → Data/Methods → Findings → Next.
- If you made a short video or recorded demo, embed with an iframe on **Home**.
