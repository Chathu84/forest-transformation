Art that integrates with and elevates our daily surroundings could offer a fresh perspective on the mundane.</p> <p>Nature in the Workplace: On a personal note, I find that art which brings elements of the outdoors inside can create a serene and motivating atmosphere, conducive to the values of sustainability that ESIIL embodies.</p> <p>Interactive Art: I believe that art installations which invite interaction or present a playful exaggeration of reality can energize our space. They have the potential to foster a creative dialogue among the team and with visitors.</p> <p>Dimensionality and Engagement: From my viewpoint, art that breaks out of the traditional two-dimensional space and engages with the viewer in three dimensions can transform the feel of an office. Such dynamic pieces could encourage innovative thinking and collaboration.</p> <p>Art with a Message: It\u2019s my opinion that the art we choose should subtly reflect our collective social and environmental commitments. Pieces that prompt introspection about our role in larger societal issues could resonate well with our team\u2019s ethos.</p> <p>Community Connection: Lastly, I feel that our office should not just be a place for work but also a space that invites community interaction. Art can be a bridge between ESIIL and the public, making our office a hub for inspiration and engagement.</p> <p> Raw photo location: antenna_girl.png</p> <p> Raw photo location: child_plant_interaction.png</p> <p> Raw photo location: hen_harrier.png Raw photo location: tree_hair.png Raw photo location: sculpture_toothpaste.png Raw photo location: tree hands.png Raw photo location: paperclip.png Raw photo location: fancy_dandilion.png Raw photo location: tree_palm.png Raw photo location: swans.png Raw photo location: diver.png Raw photo location: looker.png Raw photo location: veg_as_hair.png Raw photo location: turtle.png Raw photo location: peel_back.png Raw photo location: tree_eyes.png Raw photo location: gull_trash.png Raw photo location: monolith-alpha.png Raw photo location: veg_from_box.png</p>"},{"location":"orientation/code-of-conduct/","title":"Code of Conduct and Respectful Inclusive Collaboration Guidelines","text":"<p>CIRES Earth Lab and Environmental Data Science Innovation &amp; Inclusion Lab (ESIIL) are committed to building, maintaining, and fostering an inclusive, kind, collaborative, and diverse transdisciplinary environmental data science community, whose members feel welcome, supported, and safe to contribute ideas and knowledge.</p> <p>The Forest Carbon Codefest will follow all aspects of the ESIIL Code of Conduct (below).</p> <p>All community members are responsible for creating this culture, embodying our values, welcoming diverse perspectives and ways of knowing, creating safe inclusive spaces, and conducting ethical science as guided by FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) and CARE (Collective Benefit, Authority to Control, Responsibility, and Ethics) principles for scientific and Indigenous data management, governance, and stewardship.</p>"},{"location":"orientation/code-of-conduct/#our-values","title":"Our values","text":"<p>ESIIL\u2019s vision is grounded in the conviction that innovation and breakthroughs in environmental data science will be precipitated by a diverse, collaborative, curious, and inclusive research community empowered by open data and infrastructure, cross-sector and community partnerships, team science, and engaged learning.</p> <p>As such, our core values center people through inclusion, kindness, respect, collaboration, and genuine relationships.

The following Action will be run on the latest Ubuntu image. </p> <pre><code>name: build-and-push-jupyterlab-image\n\non:\n  workflow_dispatch:  # This allows you to manually trigger the action from GitHub UI.\n\njobs:\n\n  build:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n\n    steps:\n\n      - name: Checkout\n        uses: actions/checkout@v3.5.0\n\n      - name: Set up Docker Buildx\n        id: buildx\n        uses: docker/setup-buildx-action@v2.5.0\n\n      - name: Login to dockerhub \n        uses: docker/login-action@v2.1.0\n        with:\n          username: ${{ secrets.DOCKERHUB_USERNAME }}\n          password: ${{ secrets.DOCKERHUB_PASSWORD }}\n\n      - name: Get lowercase repo name (for dynamic tags)\n        id: repo_name  \n        run: |\n          lowercase_name=$(echo ${{ github.event.repository.name }} | tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]')\n          echo \"::set-output name=repo_name::${lowercase_name}\"\n\n      - name: Build and push latest\n        id: docker_build_jupyterlab\n        uses: docker/build-push-action@v4.0.0\n        with:\n          context: containers/jupyterlab\n          file: containers/jupyterlab/Dockerfile\n          builder: ${{ steps.buildx.outputs.name }}\n          push: true\n          tags: |\n            esiil/${{ steps.repo_name.outputs.repo_name }}_jupyterlab:latest\n\n      - name: Image digest\n        run: echo ${{ steps.docker_build.outputs.digest }}\n</code></pre> <p>The steps section of the file defines what will be run by the Action.
